<h2>Switching LEDs among two Modules</h2>
The aim of this project was to get acquinted with bluetooth communication protocol. 
In this projects our task is to build a simple bluetooth network where one bluetooth board will be used as a client and another bluetooth board as server.
When the device is switched on, the client gets connected to server and waits. When a button is pushed in the server side, notification is sent to client and a builtin led in client side switches on and switches off as soon as the button is released in the server side.
